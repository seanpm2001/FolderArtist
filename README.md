## [Benefits](#Benefits)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the benefits section]</b></p></summary>

Custom folder art can transfer between systems seamlessly through automation, rather than manual labor, and I won't have to redo the 4000+ folders on my new laptop.

</details> <!-- End of benefits section !-->

## [Concerns](#Concerns)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the concerns section]</b></p></summary>

- I have been applying folder art manually, and I have noted that navigaging through folders get slower when doing lots of folder art modification, especially for large preview images. I fear that what I did (adding at least 4000 custom folder icons throughout my system) may be contributing to system instability. I fear doing this project and having an automatic process may cause extreme system instability, high memory usage, and crashes.
- I feel this may be limited to certain desktop environments only. From testing, custom folder art has shown up only in Nautilus (GNOME/GNOME files) and not Dolphin (KDE/Dolphin)
